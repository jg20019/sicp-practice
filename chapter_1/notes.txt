Every language has: 
1. Primitives expressions
2. A means of combining them
3. A means of abstraction
 a. Giving names to combinations for reuse


Applicative Order Evaluation:
evaluate the arguments then apply

Normal Order Evaluation: 
Fully expand expressions and then reduce


Example
(define (square x)
  (* x x))

Applicative Order Evaluation
(square (+ 5 1))
(square 6)
(* 6 6)
36

Normal Order Evaluation
(square (+ 5 1))
(* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1))
(* 6 6)
36

Lisp uses applicative order evaluation.
